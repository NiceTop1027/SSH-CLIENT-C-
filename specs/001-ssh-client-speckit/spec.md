## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A system administrator needs to securely connect to remote servers via SSH to perform maintenance and configuration tasks. They want to manage multiple server connections, save frequently used connection profiles, and interact with remote systems through a terminal interface. The application should support both password and key-based authentication, display connection status clearly, and provide a reliable terminal experience with standard features like scrolling and text copying.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user opens the application for the first time, **When** they enter connection details (hostname, port, username) and select password authentication, **Then** the system should establish an SSH connection and display an interactive terminal
2. **Given** a user has a saved connection profile, **When** they select it from the session list, **Then** the system should auto-populate connection details and allow them to connect with one action
3. **Given** a user is connected to a remote server, **When** they type commands in the terminal, **Then** the system should transmit input to the server and display output in real-time
4. **Given** a user's connection is interrupted, **When** automatic reconnection is enabled, **Then** the system should attempt to re-establish the connection [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How many retry attempts? What is the retry interval?]
5. **Given** a user wants to authenticate with an SSH key, **When** they select key-based authentication, **Then** the system should allow them to select a private key file and connect without a password
6. **Given** a user is viewing terminal output, **When** they select text in the terminal, **Then** the system should allow them to copy the selected text to the clipboard

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a connection attempt fails (invalid credentials, unreachable host, timeout)? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should there be specific error messages for different failure types? Logging requirements?]
- How does the system handle disconnection during active session? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should partial output be preserved? Should there be a notification?]
- What happens when a user tries to connect to multiple servers simultaneously? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are multiple concurrent connections supported? Tab-based interface?]
- How does the system handle very long terminal output? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is there a scroll buffer limit? Output truncation policy?]
- What happens when saved session credentials become invalid?
- How does the system handle special terminal control characters and escape sequences? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What level of terminal emulation is required? VT100, xterm, other?]
- What happens when the terminal window is resized during an active session? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should terminal dimensions be updated on the server?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Connection Profile**: Represents a saved SSH connection configuration with attributes including profile name, hostname/IP address, port number, username, authentication method, and optional key file path. Each profile can be stored, retrieved, edited, and deleted by users.

- **Connection Session**: Represents an active or historical SSH connection with attributes including connection status, start time, authentication state, and associated connection profile. Links the terminal interface to the remote server.

- **Terminal Buffer**: Represents the displayed and historical terminal output with attributes including visible content, scroll history, cursor position, and text formatting. Supports user interaction like selection and scrolling.

- **Authentication Credential**: Represents authentication information with attributes including authentication type (password or key), credential data, and associated connection profile. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How are credentials stored? Are they saved with profiles or entered each time? What security measures protect stored credentials?]
